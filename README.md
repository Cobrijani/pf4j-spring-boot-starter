# PF4J Spring Boot Starter

Proof of Concepts on how to integrate PF4J library into Spring Boot as a starter.

## Note
Most of the implementation is taken from [Official PF4J implementation](https://github.com/pf4j/pf4j-spring).
Reason for not using library directly is because:
* Spring Boot parent POM is not used directly
* Spring Boot Version 2 is not compatible.
